        Hi! Welcome to our tool! :wave:
        
        ## Cover Letter, Senior Associate Data Scientist

        I am applying for the role of Senior Associate Data Scientist within the FCA. I am a Data Scientist currently within the Social Data
        Science Unit, with previous work in Enforcement-DSU and FPET- (formally JSET-) DSU. A signifcant reason for me initially joining the FCA,
        and thus a reason I am seeking to progress, is due to the purpose of the organisation. Our collective mission is relatively broad, however,
        I personally believe successfully protecting consumers from harm, promoting fair competition, or ensuring market integrity are challenging 
        yet rewarding aims which attract me and provide meaning to my work.

        Throughout my years of coding and data science work, I have been greatly fortunate to have incredible opportunities to lead and contribute on many 
        data science projects which have been of genuine use to my stakeholders and help the FCA achieve our mission. As detailed on my CV, I have had experience
        with:

        -- NLP 









        I am in the final year of my geography degree, expecting a 2:1. Always intending to have a career in business, 
        I have taken modules on the geography of business and GIS modelling. My final-year dissertation is on changing patterns in retail. 
        During my degree, I have developed my analytical skills and ability to read, manage and present data. I have also become familiar 
        with a range of business intelligence sources.

        As you can see from my CV I have experience in:

        Retail - moving from shelf stacker to checkout operator to team leader in my two years with Fresh Foods. I contributed to the store
        consistently being in the top five for the region by providing excellent customer service.
        Warehouse operations - picking and packing to meet targets over the busy Christmas period.
        
        
        
        
        As evidenced as an internal candidate, I greatly believe
        in the mission of the FCA. Although at times there are challenges in achieving our objectives with maximal efficacy, the projects I have worked on
        (detailed throughout my CV) in which I have successfully helped ensure one or more of ensuring that markets operate with integrity; 
        promoting effective competition; or protecting consumers of financial services has been personally rewarding. 

        To prove my value for the role, I will break down the role title into two distinct parts - technical and leadership. Specifics of each are covered in
        my CV, so I will provide context here to supplement. 

        For "technical", my data science ability has been evidenced in multiple projects, however I will focus on two here. The first one is a tool I built 
        in the FPET (formerly JSET) department - the Searchlight Parser Tool (hereafter: SliP). As the name suggests, the tool is built from the outputs of Advanced 
        Analytics' Searchlight tool. The outputs of SliP was originally built to the specific requirements of FPET stakeholders - a prime example of the "hub and 
        spoke model" we have here at the FCA (between AA and the business-integrated DSUs). I built SliP to solve a vital business problem with an enormous amount of
        manual overhead.
